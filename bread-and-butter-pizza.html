    <h2>Quick and tasty</h2>

    <p>If you are a fan of Detroit style pizza you’ll love this great no-dough pizza hack.<br> Butter and parmesan on the bottom of the bread caramelizes to create a delightful crunch while the top is soft.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 slices stale French or Italian bread (1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup  finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, diced</li>
        <li>18 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread butter generously on both sides of the bread slices and set them out on the prepared baking sheet. Freshly grate Parmigiano-Reggiono cheese on top of each bread slice, preeing the cheese lightly into the butter so it sticks better.<br> Turn bread slices over, so cheese side is down. Top with pizza sauce, making sure to spread it evenly on top of the slices.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms start to turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top with mozzarella and 3 pepperoni slices each (or toppings of your choice). Bake until mozzarella has melted and bottom crust is crispy and well browned, 10 to 12 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>Chefs notes</strong></h3>

    <p><em>Don’t mess with success: Yes, I’m overselling this, but I can’t help it. By insulating the bread with butter, so it doesn’t get soggy from the sauce, and adding a layer of crispy, caramelized cheese to the bottom crust, we’ve turned something unremarkable, into something that tastes, and eats like a slice of Detroit-style pizza.</em> 
    </p>

    <p><em>Use thick bread: Of course, you’ll need to use a nice, thick slice of bread, preferably one with an open crumb, so we have lots of nooks and crannies for the butter to get into, but that should be too hard to find.</em> </p>

    <p><em>Don’t overdo it: The other key tip is to not overdo the toppings. A light touch with the sauce and mozzarella will allow the magic of the crispy, buttery crust to really shine through.</em></p>
