# odin-recipes

<!--This project i am starting is the Odin Project recipes project found here-
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

This is to brush up on my skills of basic HTML and to practice what i have learned on this course.

I will be creating a recipe website with three recipes all with separate pages, it will include an img file of the dish and an unoredered list of ingredients and a ordered list of steps to follow to create the meal.

This recipes website will then be shared over the internet for anyone that wants to see.
